java spring rest maven basic, assuming i have already configured spring boot, discuss how rest api operates after enter the api url.
 In a Spring Boot application using Java with Maven as the build tool and REST API for communication, when you navigate to an entered URL that corresponds to one of your endpoints (after deploying it), here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Request Routing**: Your browser sends an HTTP GET request because entering a resource in the address bar typically results in such a call being made by default when you access REST APIs without specifying any other method like POST or PUT directly from your code/application interface (such as through Spring's RestTemplate).

2. endPoint Resolution: The Spring Boot Actuator is listening for incoming HTTP requests and, based on the URL pattern defined in `@GetMapping` annotations within controllers mapped to that route with `basePath`, it identifies which controller method should handle this request (if any), since by default spring boot does not create routes automatically.

3. Controller Invocation: The Spring Boot framework's DispatcherServlet invokes the corresponding handler (`public ResponseEntity<?> getAllOrders()` in your case) using a Prototype scope if you have specified one for your controller beans, meaning that each request gets its own instance of `OrderController` bean.

4. Data Access**: The `@Autowired` service layer components are instantiated (e.g., the repository and any other dependencies injected into the OrderService or directly within the method). Spring's dependency injection ensures these services get initialized properly, often involving database access through a data source configured by your `application.properties/yml`.

5. Business Logic Execution**: Your service layer methods execute (the business logic in this case is fetching all orders and preparing them for response). Spring's transaction management ensures that if multiple steps are involved, transactions can be appropriately managed to maintain data integrity unless explicitly disabled or configured otherwise within your application.

6. Response Preparation**: The service layer collects the result (or exception details) from business logic operations and prepares a `ResponseEntity` object containing an HTTP status code along with the body content of orders, which is typically serialized into JSON format using Jackson or similar libraries as defined in your `@RestController`'s response media type configuration (`application/json`).

7. Response Delivery**: The DispatcherServlet sends back this `ResponseEntity` to Spring WebClient (or Tomcat's Servlet container) which, after constructing the HTTP GET request with appropriate headers and status code from your handler method, hands off that response over TCP/IP protocol directly or through proxies like Nginx reverse proxy if you have such an infrastructure in place.

8. Client-side Handling**: Your browser receives this data as a JSON payload (assuming the `application/json` content type) and displays it accordingly, often using JavaScript to parse the response into HTML or another format for presenting on your webpage.

It's essential to remember that every step in this process is highly configurable with Spring Boot - including routes (`@RestController`'s `@GetMapping`), serialization/deserialization of JSON payloads (Maps structured like `application/json=com.example.demo.dto.OrderDto` for your controller methods), and how you manage transactions if any should fail during the business logic execution phase, among other aspects which can be customized according to specific project requirements or architectural decisions within a Spring Boot application ecosystem using Maven as its build tool.
